Extra Credit:

Checkout page - Our website includes a checkout page. A cart summary is displayed, showing the total payment required, 
followed by a payment form. Once the user submits valid input, they are redirected to a thank you page that 
provides shipping details, and the user's cart is cleared.

Multiple price point - Each movie can be added to the cart as a DVD ($14.95), or Blue-ray ($29.95). The cart and checkout process clearly shows the difference between the two formats for the same movies. 

Style - Organized the list of a movies and added background color, button styling, and navbar.
